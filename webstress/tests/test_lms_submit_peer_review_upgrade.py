"""Solvability proof for the upgraded lms_submit_peer_review task.

Confirms the (now harder) "redo the returned peer review" task:
  * is achievable past the real backend gate (POST /peer-reviews/{id}/submit),
  * passes the canonical_diff evaluator when the agent submits the RETURNED
    review with all three rubric criteria scored to the EXACT re-derived values
    (previous score + 2 capped at 5; unscored criterion -> 3) and a >=80-char
    comment that addresses the reviewee by first name, and
  * fails on representative near-miss trajectories (wrong review, plausible but
    NON-exact scores, too-short comment, comment missing the reviewee first name).

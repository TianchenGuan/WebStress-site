"""Solvability proof + adversarial checks for the hardened pp_transfer_prescription.

The task (hard tier, primary_primitive = state_tracking) requires the agent to:
  * reconstruct the SUBSET of active prescriptions currently filled at the
    discontinuing mail-order pharmacy (a computed set the agent must re-derive
    from each rx's ``pharmacy_id``), and
  * transfer EXACTLY that subset to the specific Walgreens retail pharmacy,
  * touching nothing else (no default change, no refill/renewal, no message).

A seeded "pharmacy closing" message lists "affected" medications BY NAME, but
that list DISAGREES with the structured per-rx truth: it omits one real
mail-order medication and names one medication that is NOT at the mail-order
pharmacy. An agent that transfers per the prose instead of reconciling against
each prescription's pharmacy fails — that is the state_tracking load.

The correct solution is driven through the REAL backend transfer endpoint
(POST /api/env/patient_portal/medications/{rx_id}/transfer) via a Starlette
TestClient bound to the app's shared SessionManager, then graded through the
canonical_diff evaluator. Several near-miss trajectories are asserted to FAIL.

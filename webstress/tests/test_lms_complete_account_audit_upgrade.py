"""Solvability + near-miss proof for the hardened lms_complete_account_audit task.

Drives the CORRECT solution through the REAL LMS backend endpoints
(TestClient over webstress.app), using the seed targets as the intended
answer, then evaluates via the canonical_diff evaluator. Also asserts a
near-miss trajectory fails.

The hardened task requires, in one account-wide orchestration:
  1. mark EVERY unread announcement as read (saturating bijection, 10 rows),
  2. submit EVERY pending peer review with full rubric scores that are NOT all
     identical (>= 2 distinct values) + >= 80-char comments (bijection over
     pending_review_ids),
  3. send ONE audit summary to the advisor whose subject states BOTH the EXACT
     re-derived unread count AND the EXACT number of peer reviews submitted, and
     whose body is >= 60 chars,
while leaving every already-read announcement, already-submitted peer
review, and all sibling collections (grades/enrollments critical) untouched.

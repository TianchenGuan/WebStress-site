"""Solvability proof for the v2-upgraded lms_review_rubric_submit task.

The v2 hardening DECOUPLES the decision from the displayed points column:
every unsubmitted assignment in the target course shows the SAME
points_possible, but their rubrics sum to DIFFERENT totals and have
DIFFERENT criteria counts. The agent must open and SUM each rubric to find
the winner (highest rubric total), break a 3-way total tie by earliest due
then alphabetical title, and name the file with the winner's rubric-criteria
count. This proves:

  * the correct trajectory (submit the rubric-total argmax winner with the
    winner's rubric-criteria-count file) still scores 1.0 / success;
  * a wrong file_name count fails (the count is load-bearing);
  * submitting the same-course equal-points look-alike (lower rubric total)
    fails — points are NOT a usable discriminator;
  * submitting the runner-up that ties on rubric total but loses the
    tie-break fails (and its different criteria count is the wrong N);
  * the cross-course decoy submission fails.

"""Solvability + discrimination proof for the hardened lms_exam_conflict task.

The upgraded task stages final exams across DISTINCT calendar days so the agent
must (1) isolate the single most-conflicted exam date among SEVERAL near-equal
busy days (one 3-course primary cluster plus TWO equal-sized 2-course decoy
clusters on other days, so a naive "the busy day" read is ambiguous), (2)
compute the current weighted grade for each course in the primary cluster — the
two lowest of which are deliberately within ~1 point, so exact weighted-grade
math (per-course category weights + drop-lowest rules) is required and eyeballing
fails — and (3) drop the one course holding the strictly-lowest weighted grade,
while leaving the higher-grade conflicting course, BOTH decoy clusters, and every
other enrollment untouched.

The correct trajectory is driven through the REAL backend mutation
(``drop_course`` route handler) using the seed ``targets`` as the intended
answer, which exercises the route's enrollment-status + drop-deadline gates.

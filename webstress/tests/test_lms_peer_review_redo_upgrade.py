"""Solvability proof for the v2-hardened lms_peer_review_redo task.

The upgraded task requires the agent to:
  * redo EVERY returned-for-revision peer review (a saturating bijection over
    target['returned_review_ids']), not just one;
  * apply a deterministic published scoring rule PER REVIEW (previous score + 2
    capped at 5; criteria with no previous score -> 3). Crucially each returned
    review now carries a DISTINCT previous_rubric_scores profile, so the
    rule-derived target triple differs per review (review_1 -> 5/3/3,
    review_2 -> 4/3/5, review_3 -> 3/5/3 for SEED 42) — the v1 "re-derive once,
    replay three times" shortcut no longer works. Every review exercises both
    rule branches (a +2->5 cap and an unscored->3 criterion);
  * write a fresh comment of at least 80 characters that addresses the reviewee
    by their first name (a per-review grounding discriminator);
  * leave every non-returned peer review (and all sibling collections) frozen,
    and send no messages.

The correct solution is driven through the REAL backend endpoint
``POST /api/env/lms/peer-reviews/{id}/submit`` via the Starlette TestClient
against the app's shared SessionManager, confirming the answer is achievable
past the real route (key sanitization + status guard). Near-miss trajectories
(constant triple replayed across reviews, wrong scores, partial redo, short
comment, name-omitting comment) must fail.

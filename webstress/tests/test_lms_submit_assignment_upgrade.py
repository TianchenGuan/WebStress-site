"""Solvability proof for the v2-upgraded lms_submit_assignment task.

The clean/base task (re-tiered easy -> medium, then hardened for grounding)
now seeds 6 courses x 8 assignments (~48 rows) with three adjacent past-due
buckets the agent must discriminate per-course:
  * RECOVERABLE-MISSING: past due, not_submitted, inside the course's late
    window (days_late <= that course's max_late_days). Submit EXACTLY these.
  * UNRECOVERABLE: past due, not_submitted, beyond the window. Must NOT submit.
  * LATE-WITHIN-GRACE: already turned in late inside grace. Must NOT touch.
The recoverable set spans MULTIPLE courses, so the per-assignment catch-up file
name "catchup_<COURSE_CODE>.pdf" must be derived from each assignment's OWN
course, not the course currently being viewed.

The canonical_diff requires:
  * a bijection over target['recoverable_missing_assignment_ids'] that must
    SATURATE (submit every one, no more no fewer),
  * a per-assignment computed file_name (catchup_<own course code>.pdf),
  * attempt_count >= initial+1 and a fresh submitted_at,
  * a comprehensive preserve-ALL invariant freezing every other assignment
    (decoys / unrecoverable / grace) at critical severity,
  * critical constraints: no unrecoverable submitted, no grace assignment
    re-submitted (attempt_count unchanged), and every freshly-submitted row is
    in the recoverable set.

The correct solution is driven through the REAL backend submit endpoint
(POST /api/env/lms/assignments/{id}/submit) via TestClient on the shared app
SessionManager so the TestClient endpoints and the evaluator share state.

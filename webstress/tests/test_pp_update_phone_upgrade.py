"""Solvability proof for the upgraded (medium-tier) pp_update_phone task.

The upgraded task is a VERIFICATION task: the values already ON FILE are
deliberate one-character look-alikes of the targets the agent must write (the
on-file phone is the new phone with the last two digits transposed; the on-file
email has a hyphen inserted in the domain; the OLD emergency contact's phone is
a look-alike of the patient's NEW phone). The agent must read, compare
character-by-character, and write the EXACT targets through the ONLY legitimate
endpoint (POST /profile/demographics), with every other patient singleton field
frozen and a wall of sibling-collection invariants plus critical/high
disambiguation constraints.

This test drives the CORRECT solution through the real backend mutation
endpoint via TestClient (so it also confirms the action clears every gate),
then evaluates with the unified evaluator. It also asserts that the OLD easy
answer and several plausible look-alike / cross-wire near-misses now FAIL.

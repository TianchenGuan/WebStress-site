"""Solvability proof for the upgraded ``lms_view_late_policy`` task.

The task asks the agent to read EACH course's late policy, re-derive the set of
recoverable overdue assignments (past due but within the course's max_late_days,
*inclusive* of the boundary), and submit every one of them with
``late_submit.pdf`` (bijection saturation) — while leaving the unrecoverable
overdue assignments (overdue by even one day MORE than max_late_days) and
already-submitted work untouched, and sending no messages.

The v2 upgrade makes the recoverability computation genuinely hard for a strong
model: ``boundary_missing_count`` seeds, in every course (whose policies vary
7 / 5 / 3 max late days), a BOUNDARY PAIR — one assignment overdue by EXACTLY
max_late_days (recoverable) and one overdue by max_late_days + 1 (unrecoverable).
An off-by-one in the per-course day count flips a recoverable into an
unrecoverable (trips the critical constraint) or vice-versa (drops a required
submission). The recoverable set is now multi-element (6-7 assignments), so the
bijection must saturate across courses.

The correct trajectory is driven through the REAL backend submit endpoint via
starlette TestClient so the proof also confirms the action is reachable past the
``/assignments/{id}/submit`` gates.

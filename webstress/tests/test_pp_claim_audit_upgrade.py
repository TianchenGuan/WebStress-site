"""Solvability proof for the hardened pp_claim_audit task (v2).

The hardened task seeds a MIX of denied claims: 12 eligible (denied + EOB +
future deadline) plus 8 denied-but-INELIGIBLE lookalikes (4 with no EOB, 4
with an already-expired appeal deadline). The 8 ineligible lookalikes ALL carry
a HIGHER patient_responsibility than every genuine eligible claim (their PR is
drawn from [1600, 2000] while the genuine eligible max is 1500), so the top-8
by raw patient_responsibility are ALL ineligible decoys. An agent that ranks
top-3-by-PR without first applying the full eligibility filter picks decoys the
appeal route rejects (422).

The 12 eligible claims also contain a DELIBERATE 3-way tie at PR 1300 spanning
the top-3 boundary: the genuine top-3 is {clm_4(1500), clm_5(1300), clm_6(1300)}
and clm_7(1300) is the EXCLUDED #4. Membership of the third slot is decided by
the ascending-claim-id tiebreaker, so a model that holds the ranked set but
skips the tiebreaker picks the wrong third claim and trips the exact-3
bijection.

The intended answer is target['top_3_appealable_claim_ids']. We drive the
correct solution through the REAL backend appeal endpoint via TestClient to
confirm the answer is achievable past the route's gates (denied + eob +
deadline), then assert the canonical_diff evaluator scores it as a pass.

"""Solvability + difficulty proof for the upgraded pp_file_claim_appeal task.

The task was escalated from `hard` (single denied-claim appeal by earliest
deadline) to `expert`: the agent must now identify EVERY appealable denied
claim (denied + EOB available + appeal_deadline >= now), rank them by appeal
deadline (earliest first, claim-ID tie-break), and appeal EXACTLY the two
most-urgent — while leaving the OTHER appealable denied claims (the most
tempting siblings, including one with a far larger patient responsibility)
untouched, along with every approved/processing claim and all other records.

The v2 upgrade makes the eligibility FILTER load-bearing and the deadline
ranking ROBUST (the two weaknesses found in the empirical failure analysis):
  * the seed now plants INELIGIBLE denied decoys (no EOB, and past-deadline)
    so the agent must apply the full 3-clause filter (status==denied AND
    eob_available AND appeal_deadline>=now), not just "appeal every denied
    claim"; and
  * the eligible claims get DETERMINISTIC, monotonically-spaced deadlines so
    rank-1/rank-2 are each unambiguously earlier than rank-3 by a comfortable
    margin (no more RNG-clustered 0-day-gap coin-flips), with exactly ONE
    intentional same-deadline tie pair among the LATEST eligible claims to
    exercise the claim-id tiebreaker deliberately (and away from the answer).

This module proves:
  * the intended answer (`top_2_urgent_appealable_claim_ids`) is achievable by
    driving the REAL backend `/claims/{id}/appeal` endpoint past its gates
    (status==denied, eob_available, deadline>=now), and scores >= 0.99;
  * the ineligible denied decoys are genuinely excluded AND backend-rejected;
  * the deadline ranking is robust (rank-2 vs rank-3 gap is comfortable);
  * a near-miss (appealing by patient-responsibility rank instead of deadline,
    i.e. the pp_claim_audit heuristic) FAILS — confirming the new
    deadline-ranking discriminator genuinely bites.

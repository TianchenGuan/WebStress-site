"""Solvability proof for the hardened (v2) lms_course_load_analysis task.

The upgraded task no longer spells out the closed-form projection formula or the
2.0 grade-point mapping. The agent must DERIVE the credit-weighted GPA rule and,
critically, sum credit hours over ONLY the actively-enrolled courses. The seed now
plants a WAITLISTED decoy course (status != enrolled) with real credit hours: an
agent that counts it inflates the current credit total and flips the safe/not-safe
branch. The authoritative ``can_add_course`` / ``lowest_performing_course_id`` are
computed enrolled-scoped in grade_book (enrolled_scoped_decision=true), so:

  * projected GPA >= 3.0 (enrolled credits)  -> mark every unread announcement read
  * projected GPA <  3.0 (enrolled credits)  -> drop the lowest-weighted enrolled
                                                course

With the current seed config (must_include MATH201+PHYS201+CS101, count=5,
include_waitlisted), the enrolled credit total is pinned near the 3.0 boundary:

  * seed=0 -> 14 enrolled credits -> projected 2.99 (< 3.0) -> Branch 2 (drop). The
    NAIVE all-courses total (incl. the waitlisted decoy) is 17, which would project
    >= 3.0 and wrongly choose Branch 1 -- this is the load-bearing trap.
  * seed=1 -> 15 enrolled credits -> projected 3.00 (>= 3.0) -> Branch 1 (mark read).

Both branches are driven through the REAL LMS backend endpoints
(POST /courses/{id}/drop and POST /announcements/mark_all_read) to confirm the
intended answer is reachable past the server gates.

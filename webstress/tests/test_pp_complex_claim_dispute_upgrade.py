"""Solvability + integrity proof for the hardened pp_complex_claim_dispute task.

The v2 task requires the agent to RE-DERIVE the genuinely-appealable denied-claim
subset (status=='denied' AND eob_available AND appeal_deadline not passed) and then
select, from that subset, ONLY the TWO claims with the EARLIEST appeal deadlines —
appealing exactly those two via the real backend appeal action, while leaving the
*other* appealable claims (later deadlines, which the backend WOULD let it appeal),
the non-appealable denied decoys (no-EOB / past-deadline), the approved claims, and
the processing claims untouched.

The key difficulty over v1: the discriminator is now an URGENCY SUBSET, not "appeal
every appealable claim". The backend no longer filters the answer for the agent —
it will happily appeal any appealable denied claim — so over-appealing the
later-deadline appealable claims is a genuine, server-unblocked hazard. The two
highest-balance appealable claims are deliberately NOT the two most urgent, so a
"rank by dollar amount" heuristic produces the wrong pair.

Correct trajectory is driven through the REAL backend endpoint
(POST /api/env/patient_portal/claims/{id}/appeal) via starlette TestClient so this
also confirms the intended answer set passes every backend appeal gate.

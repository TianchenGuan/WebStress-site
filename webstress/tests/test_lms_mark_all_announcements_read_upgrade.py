"""Solvability proof for the v2-upgraded lms_mark_all_announcements_read task.

v1 re-tiered easy -> medium: mark ONLY the unread *urgent* announcements as read,
leaving every unread normal-priority (and every already-read) announcement
untouched. v2 makes the grounding load genuinely harder for a frontier model by
turning the discriminator into a 3-axis, cross-collection join rather than a
plain 2-field filter:

  * priority x is_read cross-product is now fully populated — the seed contains
    unread+urgent (some are targets), unread+normal (decoys, must stay unread),
    AND read+urgent (urgent-looking decoys that are already read), so neither
    "filter on priority" nor "filter on is_read" alone is sufficient.
  * a course-scoping discriminator: the student is a TA in exactly one course.
    The urgent+unread announcement posted in that TA course is a DECOY — the
    agent must JOIN announcement.course_id against enrollment.role and EXCLUDE
    the TA course's urgent announcement from the target set.

Correct trajectory: mark exactly the unread+urgent announcements posted in a
course where the student is enrolled as a *student* (role != "ta"). Driven
through the REAL backend endpoint POST /announcements/{id}/read via starlette
TestClient so the proof confirms the action is reachable past all gates.

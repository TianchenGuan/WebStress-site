"""Solvability proof for the hardened pp_resolve_schedule_conflicts task (v2).

The task seeds several groups of double/triple-booked appointments that share
an exact date+time. In each group exactly one appointment was booked first
(earliest ``booked_at``, tie-break lexicographic id) and must be KEPT; every
other (later-booked) member of the group must be CANCELLED. Non-conflicting
upcoming appointments must be left untouched.

The v2 upgrade adds two discrimination traps on top of the multi-cluster core:

* A ``keeper_trap`` cluster where the earliest-booked keeper deliberately sits
  on a *specialist* provider with a ``telehealth`` visit type while the
  later-booked duplicates sit on the PCP with ``in-person`` — so a naive
  "keep the PCP / in-person one" heuristic cancels the keeper.
* ``pseudo_conflict`` decoy groups where a scheduled appointment shares its
  exact datetime with an already-``completed`` appointment. These are NOT real
  conflicts (only one member is scheduled), so the scheduled survivor must be
  LEFT scheduled. An agent that groups by datetime without first filtering to
  ``status == 'scheduled'`` will cancel it (a critical over-cancellation).

The CORRECT solution is driven through the REAL backend cancel endpoint
(POST /api/env/patient_portal/appointments/{id}/cancel) using the seed's
precomputed ``cluster_cancel_apt_ids`` as the intended answer. WRONG
trajectories (cancelling the keeper, a pseudo-conflict survivor, a
non-conflicting appointment, or missing one duplicate) are asserted to fail.

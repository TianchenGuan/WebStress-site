"""Solvability proof for the hardened ``pp_dispute_claim`` task.

The upgraded task asks the agent to appeal the *3 most-recent eligible* denied
claims (denied + EOB available + appeal deadline not passed), ordered by service
date descending (claim-id descending tiebreak), and to leave every other claim
untouched. This module proves:

  1. The intended answer (seed target ``recent_appealable_claim_ids``) is
     achievable through the REAL backend appeal endpoint past its guards
     (status==denied, eob_available, deadline>=now), and that driving exactly
     that set makes the canonical_diff evaluator pass with score >= 0.99.
  2. Near-miss trajectories fail: (a) appealing only TWO of the three required
     claims (under-action breaks the bijection), (b) appealing an ineligible /
     lower-recency denied claim (over-action trips the critical out-of-scope
     invariant), (c) appealing the lower-numbered claim of a SERVICE-DATE TIE
     instead of the documented later-numbered one (the tiebreaker is
     load-bearing), and (d) appealing the NEWEST-of-all denied claim, which is a
     no-EOB sort-order trap (a recency-before-filter agent mis-fires).

Method: the correct solution is driven through the real HTTP endpoint
``POST /api/env/patient_portal/claims/{id}/appeal`` via starlette TestClient,
sharing the app's SessionManager so the post-appeal state is the one evaluated.
Near-miss cases mirror the same endpoint effect (status->appealed) to keep the
proof fast and deterministic.

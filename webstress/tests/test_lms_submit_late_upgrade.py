"""Solvability proof for the hardened ``lms_submit_late`` task (v2).

Drives the CORRECT solution through the REAL LMS backend endpoints
(``/api/env/lms/session`` + ``/api/env/lms/assignments/{id}/submit``) using the
seed ``resolved_targets`` as the intended answer, then evaluates the live state
through the canonical-diff evaluator. Also exercises several near-miss
trajectories that must FAIL.

The hardened task no longer leaks the assignment id/title or the file name in
its instruction. The agent must:
  * filter to past-due, never-submitted assignments,
  * compute each one's days-late against its own course's late-submission
    window (``max_late_days``), and
  * identify the single assignment still inside its window.

v2 hardening (the load-bearing difficulty lever): the seed now plants a
SAME-DAYS-LATE LOOK-ALIKE — a past-due never-submitted assignment in a STRICTER
course that is the EXACT same number of days late as the sole recoverable target
but is already OUTSIDE its (smaller) window. "Sort by how many days late" no
longer separates the answer from the trap; the agent must read each course's
``max_late_days`` and do per-course window math. Submitting the look-alike trips
a high-severity look-alike constraint, a critical "out-of-window submission"
constraint, and the critical "only the target changed" constraint.

The seed builder guarantees exactly one recoverable past-due assignment (with
margin against the floating seed anchor), so ``target_assignment_id`` /
``required_file_name`` are the unambiguous intended answer.

"""Solvability + adversarial proof for the upgraded ``lms_grade_with_curve``.

The upgraded task is a two-branch ``oneof`` gated on a seed-computed
discriminator the agent must re-derive (does +5 on the midterm cross a letter
band for the target course?).

* Branch 1 (curve RAISES the letter grade): acknowledge by marking EVERY
  unread announcement that belongs to the target course as read — a saturating
  bijection over the precomputed ``unread_target_announcement_ids`` set, with
  other-course unread announcements present as distractors that must NOT be
  touched (so a blunt ``mark_all_read`` fails).
* Branch 2 (curve does NOT change the letter grade): submit
  ``curve_appeal.pdf`` to the midterm assignment with tightened field
  predicates (exact file name, freshness, attempt increment).

All correct solutions are driven through the REAL LMS backend route handlers
(``mark_announcement_read`` / ``submit_assignment``) so the proof confirms the
intended answer is achievable past every server gate.

Canonical eval seed is 42 (validate stage 3 + variant integrity both use it),
which lands on Branch 1. Branch 2 is proven on seed 3, where the discriminator
is ``false`` and the target-course midterm is submittable.

The v2 upgrade calibrates the target course's graded midterm + supporting
grades so the *displayed* weighted score sits at a sharp near-90 boundary: a
+5-point midterm curve crosses the A/B letter line on Branch-1 seeds and stays
inside the same band on Branch-2 seeds. The discriminator the agent must
re-derive (weighted score with drop-lowest + re-normalization over graded
categories, then +5 on the midterm, then the A>=90/B>=80 band) is therefore a
genuine boundary computation rather than a far-from-edge flag.

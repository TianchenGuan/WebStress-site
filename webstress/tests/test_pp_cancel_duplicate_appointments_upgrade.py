"""Solvability + near-miss proof for the upgraded pp_cancel_duplicate_appointments.

The upgraded task is HARD: three appointments share the exact same datetime,
each booked at a different time. The agent must KEEP only the earliest-booked
one and CANCEL the other two, each with an exact cancellation_reason. The
keep/cancel partition is a seed-computed discriminator (the agent cannot infer
it from id order — booked_at ordering is permuted per seed, so the
earliest-booked member is NOT the lowest-id / first-listed appointment).

v2 hardening verified here:
  * booked_at is decoupled from id/creation order (conflict_shuffle_booked_at),
    so an agent that just keeps the first/lowest-id same-time appointment fails;
  * a SECOND same-time group of legitimately-distinct visits must be left
    untouched (cancelling one fails the frozen-sibling invariant);
  * a critical `constraints` predicate independently pins the kept member as the
    earliest-BOOKED one, so mis-ordering the timestamps fails even before the
    invariant fires.

The CORRECT solution is driven through the REAL backend cancel endpoint via
starlette TestClient, using the seed `targets` as the intended answer; this
confirms the answer is achievable past every backend guard. WRONG / near-miss
trajectories must fail.

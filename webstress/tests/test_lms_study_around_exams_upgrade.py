"""Solvability proof for the hardened lms_study_around_exams task.

The task was upgraded from medium → hard (v2). The agent must:
  1. Read the calendar and identify which courses have an exam in the next 14 days
     — where several exams sit RIGHT around the 14-day boundary (days 12-13 just
     inside, days 15-16 just outside), so a per-course exam-date-vs-cutoff
     comparison is required (not "the nearest few exams").
  2. Mark ONLY the UNREAD announcements in those exam-courses as read.
  3. Leave every other announcement untouched (unread announcements in
     non-exam courses — including the near-boundary day-15/16 courses — and
     already-read announcements everywhere).

The discriminator (unread AND course-has-upcoming-exam) is precomputed in the
seed builder and exposed as the scalar target ``unread_in_exam_courses_ids``.
The correct solution sweeps exactly that set via the real backend endpoint.

Modeled on test_pp_immunization_end_to_end.py.

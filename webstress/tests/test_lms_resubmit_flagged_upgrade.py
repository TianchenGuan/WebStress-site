"""Solvability proof for the v2 (expert-tier) lms_resubmit_flagged task.

The v2 base adds GENUINE backtracking + verification load on top of the v1
per-row filename arithmetic:

- 4 resubmittable flagged assignments, each with a distinct prior attempt_count,
  all resubmittable past the real backend gates (attempt_count < max_attempts).
- 1 BLOCKED flagged assignment (submission_status still "resubmit_requested" but
  attempt_count == max_attempts) so BOTH the /resubmit and /submit endpoints
  return 422. The agent must discover the 422 blocker mid-task, abandon that row,
  and NOT count it -- it is EXCLUDED from resubmit_assignment_ids.
- 1 GRADED look-alike sharing a flagged assignment's title in a different course
  (the /submit endpoint accepts "graded", so it looks resubmittable). The agent
  must match submission_status == "resubmit_requested" exactly, not the title.

Confirms:
- Driving the CORRECT solution (resubmit exactly the 4 resubmittable rows with the
  per-assignment derived filename revision_v{attempt_count+1}.pdf) via the REAL
  resubmit endpoint evaluates to success and score >= 0.99.
- The blocked row is genuinely un-resubmittable (422 on both endpoints) and leaving
  it untouched is correct; forcing a change on it fails the critical guard.
- Near-misses fail: uniform filename, skipping a flagged row, and touching the
  graded title look-alike.

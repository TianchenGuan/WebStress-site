"""Solvability proof for the hardened pp_rx_cost_optimization task.

The upgraded task asks the agent to:
  1. Identify the single mail-order pharmacy with the LOWEST 90-day supply cost
     (a computed discriminator — the destination is no longer named in the
     instruction; the agent must price-compare several mail-order options).
  2. Transfer EXACTLY the active prescriptions that are currently filled at a
     retail (non-mail-order) pharmacy AND still have >=1 refill remaining
     (a precomputed eligibility bijection) to that cheapest mail-order pharmacy.
  3. Leave every other prescription (zero-refill active, already-at-mail-order
     active, expired) frozen; not touch the default pharmacy; send no messages;
     request no renewal.

This drives the CORRECT solution through the real
``POST /api/env/patient_portal/medications/{rx_id}/transfer`` endpoint and
asserts the canonical_diff evaluator scores it as a pass, then drives several
near-miss trajectories and asserts each fails.

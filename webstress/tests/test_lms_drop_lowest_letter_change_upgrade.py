"""Solvability proof for the v2 (expert) lms_drop_lowest_letter_change task.

The v2 base deterministically FORCES the demanding "submit" branch on every
seed (the v1 random distribution almost never produced it, so frontier models
trivially took the one-click "mark announcement" branch and the
recompute-and-verify weak point was never exercised). The ``grade_book`` builder
re-sculpts the TARGET course's homework grades into a fully re-derivable
configuration with three compounding, FAIR verification traps:

  X: 80/100 (ratio 0.80), late_penalty 0.15  -> the homework the engine drops
  P: 92/100 (ratio 0.92)
  A: 99/100 (ratio 0.99)
  Z:  9/10  (ratio 0.90)                      -> LOWEST raw EARNED points

Engine view (the Grades page the agent reads, which applies the (1 - penalty)
factor and re-derives drops):
  * WITH the drop applied  -> 93.67  -> A
  * WITHOUT the drop       -> 87.25  -> B
=> the coarse letter genuinely flips (B -> A) => drop_changes_letter_grounded
   == 'true' => branch 1 (submit ``letter_grade_report.pdf`` for X, the dropped
   homework = lowest score-to-points RATIO).

Three traps an agent can fall into, each of which FAILS:
  1. THRESHOLD/LATE-PENALTY: forget the late penalty on X and the WITHOUT-drop
     score reads as 90.25 (an A) -> no flip -> the agent wrongly marks the
     announcement (branch 2's action) -> trips the critical wrong-branch
     invariant.
  2. RATIO trap: submit the lowest raw EARNED-points homework (Z) instead of X
     (lowest ratio) -> wrong assignment.
  3. Wrong file name.

Drives the CORRECT solution through the REAL LMS backend submit endpoint via
Starlette TestClient, then evaluates via the unified evaluator. Also proves the
wrong / near-miss trajectories fail.

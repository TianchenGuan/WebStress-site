"""Solvability proof for the upgraded ``pp_pay_claim`` task.

The upgraded task asks the agent to pay (zero out ``patient_responsibility``)
the THREE highest-balance approved insurance claims that have an available EOB
(ranked by patient responsibility, claim-id tiebreak), while leaving every other
claim — the cheaper approved claims, the processing claim, and all denied claims —
untouched, and sending no messages.

Levers exercised here:
  * seed-computed discriminator the agent must re-derive (top-K by
    patient_responsibility) — exposed as target ``top_k_payable_claim_ids``;
  * a SATURATING bijection over that target list (pay all 3, no excess);
  * a filtered critical invariant freezing every non-target claim;
  * exact-value + provenance expr predicates (``initial.get_claim``).

Correct path is driven through the REAL backend ``POST /claims/{id}/pay``
endpoint via ``starlette.testclient.TestClient(app)`` to confirm achievability
past the route's ``patient_responsibility > 0`` gate.

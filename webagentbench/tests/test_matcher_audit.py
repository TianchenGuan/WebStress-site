"""Audit battery for the canonical_diff matcher.

Each test probes a specific hypothesis about how the matcher could
produce a wrong score. Tests are designed to fail noisily when they
find a real bug and document the expected behavior when they pass.

Structure:
  Part A — consistency sweeps parametrized over every migrated task.
  Part B — targeted unit tests on synthetic canonical_diffs.

If Part A fires, the bug reproduces on real task data (high signal,
hard to dismiss). If Part B fires, it isolates a specific matcher
branch with a minimal fixture (easy to debug).

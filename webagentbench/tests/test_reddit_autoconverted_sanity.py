"""Sanity tests for auto-converted Reddit canonical_diffs.

The 48 Reddit tasks auto-converted from legacy eval.checks into
constraint-only canonical_diff blocks don't have hand-written
happy-path tests. This file locks in two invariants per task:

1. The canonical_diff loads cleanly via the registry.
2. Do-nothing trajectory doesn't trivially score 1.0 (the task genuinely
   requires agent action).

Tasks that legitimately have no action required — or whose constraints
all trivially hold on the initial state — are expected to score 1.0 and
are listed in ``NO_ACTION_REQUIRED_TASKS`` below.

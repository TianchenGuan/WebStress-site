"""Parametrized adversarial battery for every migrated task.

Replaces ~130 per-task ``test_<task_id>_adversarial.py`` files that were
byte-identical except for the task_id string. Tasks with bespoke
adversarial coverage keep their own file under the same name; this
battery runs in addition to (not instead of) those.

For every task that has a ``canonical_diff`` block:
- synthesize violating final states via ``synthesize_adversarial_cases``
- assert the matcher rejects every one

If this file fails with ``report.passed is True`` on a case, either the
matcher regressed or the canonical_diff admits states it shouldn't.

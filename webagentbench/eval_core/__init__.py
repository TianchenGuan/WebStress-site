"""Unified WebAgentBench evaluator.

Single evaluation path: every task's ``canonical_diff`` block is matched
against the computed state diff. Legacy ``eval.checks`` / ``negative_checks``
are no longer supported.

Public entry:
    from webagentbench.eval_core import evaluate
    result = evaluate(task, server_state, targets, trajectory)
